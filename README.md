# Parametric-Equation-Drawer
This program can draw and animate parametric equations. It colours them in a rainbow gradient, which animates through a continuous loop. There are examples for the fibonacci spiral, the butterfly equation, circles, bezier equations, and text. All output files go in the out folder.
